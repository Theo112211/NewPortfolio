        <p class="ABmessage">My fullname is Appiah Theophilus Boadi though everybody calls me <b>Theo</b>.
            I am a 22 year
            old Ghanaian male originally from the Techimantia
            township of the Bono Region
            and <em>currently</em> residing at Abuakwa in the Ashanti Region.
            Before living at Abuakwa, I and my family move around a bit through
            different towns Bechem, Sepaase and Foase where they currently live.
            <br>
            <br>
            I've done most of my schooling in the Ashanti region but I have early
            memories of schooling elsewhere. My parents confirm I started schooling at Bechem,
            a place to which they move after I was born. I went through <em>part of</em> Kindergarten and the entirity
            of my lower primaries at Star of Hope International School at Sepaase New Site.
            <br>
            From there I continued the rest of my primary and Junior High Education at
            Kwadaso S.D.A. JHS situated at Kwadaso, Silium Junction.
            <br>
            <br>
            I completed with desent grades and went on to seek and acquired admission
            in the General Science Course at Toase Senior High popularly known as TOSS, where I was part of the
            first batch of science students to take geography as an elective. Those three years changed me a lot.
            It was a period of self discovery, both emotional and physiological.
            I learned in the addition the schools curricullum, how to make good friends, how be a friend,
            how to love, a feeling I chose to ignore and essentially how to be <b>me</b>.
            I grew attached and did not want it to end but it had to.
            The time came and I had to say good bye to a place I hold dear.
            But life goes on and so after having passed so well, I prepared to persue
            my aspiration of becoming a <b>programmer</b>.
            <br>
            <br>
            My parent though had other plans, they intended for me to wait a year and get some
            experience outside of the school environment and they had the power so I had no say in the matter.
            So I accepted without question beacause I knew my father wants my help with the church.
            During that time, I sought employment as a teacher at Radiant Academy, a school
            located at Atwima Foase, where we all lived back then. I worked there for nine months for a salary of 110
            cedis
            a month and managed, somehow to have saved 900 cedis afterward. I also managed to start learning
            <b><em>Graphic Designing</em></b> in the time. My employment as well as
            plans to further my education was halted by the unfortunate <b><em>COVID-19</em></b> because of which I had
            to
            stay home for an extra year further delaying te realization of my aspirations.
            <br>
            <br>
            A year went by and all seemed to be well even though many were lost to the virus, we made and so
            life goes on. So I applied at <b>AAMUSTED</b> university at Tanoso to persue the course of computer science
            which,
            it turns out they didn't do at the time leaving me no choice but to settle for an IT course, Bsc Information
            Technology Education.
            This decision was approved by my parents because at AAMUSTED the course has an educational aspect
            which means after I complete it, I will also be a qualified teacher.
            And so that is what I am currently in the middle of, my GPA is high enough and things are looking good.
            I'm working hard to keep them that way with hope that with God by my side,
            I will succeed.
